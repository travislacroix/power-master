# power-master

This program utilizes a Nash bargaining game played between two heterogeneous populations.
This model is built in the spirit of Axtell, et al. (2001), and builds on previous work from Oâ€™Connor and Bruner (2017). 

The model describes how a small degree of power afforded to a single member (proportion) of the population affects the expected outcome of bargaining situations. We find that this has a global (population-level) effect on the frequency of discriminatory conventions.
